# What Is MW Tool

It's a tool or a third party program that helps you making a trick shot in MW without memory editing 

I'm using a simple method to move the mouse by using user32 events and DirectX 


# Important Changes 
- Make Webhook Request In The Line `274` Or Remove The Code Inside The Box
- Make AutoClicker That Works While Holding The Mouse Left Button Or just Use The Shitty One In The Code
- Go Fuck Yourself
